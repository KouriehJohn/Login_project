# Login_project
Creating a Login form with HTML &amp; CSS3
Completed the file login_style.css (just got it working)

Uploaded a comparison file with a 1 added. Ths comparision file for 
example works. The problem was the container for 'Please Login:' so
I started to search the style sheet for the form, login, and .form_header.

Turns out my fingers typed .form-header instead. Bug found.

1/25 working on edits to the responsivness of the Login_project
- created a login_style2.css
- The login button keeps moving, code looks the same... not sure.

login_project.css to login_project2.css are working. 2 less than the original.

keep, sample and A are all my versions of version control.
