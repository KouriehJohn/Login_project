# Login_project
Creating a Login form with HTML &amp; CSS3
Completed the file login_style.css (just got it working)

Uploaded a comparison file with a 1 added. Ths comparision file for 
example works. The problem was the container for 'Please Login:' so
I started to search the style sheet for the form, login, and .form_header.

Turns out my fingers typed .form-header instead. Bug found.
